# Power BI Semantic Model Modeling Guidelines

This document describes the modeling guidelines that should be applied when developing against a Power BI semantic model.

## Core Principles

- **Consistency Over Perfection** - When working with an existing semantic model, first analyze its established development patterns and align your work with them. 
- **Star schema modeling** - When modeling data, always default to a star schema: use a single fact table with denormalized dimension tables, clear one-column relationship keys, and one-to-many relationships. Only deviate if there is a strong, explicit requirement that a star schema cannot satisfy. Avoid snowflake dimensions.
- **Explicit over implicit** - Always use explicit measures instead of relying on implicit aggregations. Hide aggregatable columns and create measures for them.
- **Lean models** - Only include columns and tables that are needed for analysis. Remove unused objects to keep the model small and fast.
- **Memory awareness** - High-cardinality columns (GUIDs, transaction IDs, composite keys, unsplit DateTime) are the biggest memory consumers. Every column costs memory even if no one uses it. When in doubt, ask the user if the column is really required.

## Naming Conventions

See [naming-conventions.md](naming-conventions.md) for the complete naming convention rules.

## Tables

At its core, a semantic model table consists of:
- Columns
- Measures
- Partitions (query to the data source)

**Table Creation Rules:**

**DO:**
- Start by creating the partition and the query to the data source. For Direct Lake models (see [Direct Lake Modeling Guidelines](direct-lake-guidelines.md)).
- Manually create all required columns with proper data types. The sourceColumn column property must map to the column name from the partition query.
- Default to M partition source type with import mode. Unless it's a Direct Lake Model.
- Add a `description` to tables to document their purpose and grain.
- Ensure every table has at least one relationship to another table in the model (except utility tables).

**DON'T:**
- Use Power Query M code for tables with Direct Lake storage.
- Create shared named expressions for the table query.
- Leave orphan tables disconnected from the model without a clear reason.


## Table partitions

Consider the following table to better understand partition types and storage modes:

| Partition source type                  | Storage mode                  | Typical usage                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| M (MPartitionSource)                   | Import/DirectQuery            | Default type. The query uses Power Query (M code).                                                                                                           |
| Entity (EntityPartitionSource)         | DirectLake                    | There is no M expression. Used when it's connecting the semantic model table to a data source entity that can be a Lakehouse table. |
| Calculated (CalculatedPartitionSource) | Import                        | Used for calculated tables where the query is a DAX expression.                                                                                                      |

**Partition naming:** For single-partition tables, the partition name should match the table name.

## Table Columns

**DO:**
- The `sourceColumn` property must map to the partition source expression. Every data column must have a `sourceColumn`.
- Ensure the `dataType` property is defined. Except for calculated tables where type can be inferred from the DAX expression.
  - Use efficient data types (case-sensitive):
    - `Int64`: Keys and identifiers
    - `Decimal`: Currency and precise numbers (limited to 4 decimal digits)
    - `String`: Text data
    - `DateTime`: Dates and timestamps
    - `Boolean`: True/false values
  - **Avoid `Double` (floating point)** — causes roundoff errors and degraded performance. Use `Decimal` or `Int64` instead.
- Hide technical columns: `IsHidden = true`. Examples: ID columns, Foreign key columns, System columns.
- Hide fact table columns that are aggregated in measures (the measure is the user-facing interface).
- Split combined DateTime columns into separate Date and Time columns. A DateTime with time precision creates near-unique cardinality and inflates dictionary size significantly.
- Watch for high-cardinality text columns (GUIDs, transaction IDs, composite string keys). These inflate dictionary size and hurt compression. If only used for relationships, consider integer surrogates in the data source.
- Disable summarization for non-aggregatable numerics: `SummarizeBy = None`. Examples: IDs, phone numbers, postal codes, year, month number, day of week
- Set `isAvailableInMdx = false` on hidden columns that are not used as `SortByColumn`, not referenced in user hierarchies, and not used in variations. This saves memory and processing time.
- Set `dataCategory` for geographic columns (e.g., `City`, `Country`, `Continent` → `dataCategory: "City"`, `"Country"`, etc.) and for latitude/longitude columns.
- For flag/boolean columns (names starting with "Is" or ending with "Flag"), prefer `String` type with "Yes"/"No" values for readability, or keep as `Boolean`.
- Configure `sortByColumn` for text columns that need non-alphabetical sorting (e.g., month names sorted by month number). Make sure the column used exists in the model and `isAvailableInMdx` is not `false`.
- Always refer to columns including the table name. For example: `'Table Name'[Column Name]`

**DON'T:**
- Use columns that don't map to a column in the partition source in both name and data type.
- Use `Double` data type - use `Decimal` or `Int64` instead.
- Leave foreign key columns visible - always hide them.
- Keep columns that are not referenced by any measure, relationship, or report visual - they waste memory and slow refresh.
- Exceed ~30 visible columns per table - this usually signals a denormalization issue. Consider splitting into proper star schema dimensions.
  
## Calculated Columns

Calculated columns are evaluated during data refresh for every row. Use them sparingly.

**DO:**
- Prefer measures over calculated columns whenever the logic can be expressed as an aggregation.
- If a calculated column is needed, consider whether the computation can be pushed upstream to the data source (Power Query or warehouse) for better performance.

**DON'T:**
- Create calculated columns that simply aggregate or filter - use a measure instead.
- Use calculated columns for values that change with filter context - that is what measures are for.

## Measures & DAX

> For DAX language coding patterns, syntax rules, and best practices, see [dax-guidelines.md](dax-guidelines.md).

**DO:**
- Create explicit measures for aggregatable numeric columns. When creating a measure, make sure the numeric column is hidden and doesn't have the same name.
- Distribute measures across relevant tables (avoid the single "Measures" table).
- Always set an appropriate `formatString` for the measure (see [Format String Reference](#format-string-reference)).
- Add `description` to measures to explain business logic, especially for complex calculations.
- Use `displayFolder` to organize measures into logical groups within each table.
- When creating a measure, if working against online database, test it with a simple query.
- If creating measures in a model consumed by Copilot or data agents, ensure measures are model-level (not report-scoped extension measures, which are invisible to AI).

**DON'T:**
- Use implicit aggregations from numeric columns.
- Store all measures in a single dedicated table.
- Create untested measures.
- Set `dataType` — measure data types are inferred from DAX expressions at runtime.
- Create duplicate measures (two measures with the same DAX expression).
- Create measures that are just direct references to other measures (e.g., `[MeasureB] := [MeasureA]`).

### Format String Reference

**Standard Format Strings:**

| Format Type | Format String | Example Output | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Currency | `"\\$#,##0.00"` | $1,234.56 | Note double backslash (`\\`) |
| Percentage | `"0.00%"` | 45.67% | Two decimal places |
| Integer | `"#,##0"` | 1,234 | No decimal places |
| Decimal | `"#,##0.00"` | 1,234.56 | Two decimal places |
| Thousands | `"#,##0,K"` | 1,234K | Abbreviated |
| Millions | `"#,##0,,M"` | 1.23M | Abbreviated |
| No Decimals | `"0"` | 1234 | No thousands separator |
| One Decimal | `"#,##0.0"` | 1,234.5 | One decimal place |

**Special Characters:**
- `#` = Optional digit
- `0` = Required digit
- `,` = Thousands separator
- `.` = Decimal separator
- `%` = Percentage multiplier
- `\\` = Escape character (required before `$` and other special chars)

**Critical:** Every visible measure must have a `formatString` assigned.

## Relationships

**DO:**
- Create relationships before measures (measures may reference them)
- Default to single-directional: `CrossFilteringBehavior = "OneDirection"`
- Prefer integer keys over string keys (performance optimization)
- Ensure relationship columns on both sides have the same `dataType` (mismatched types cause errors and performance issues)
- Set `isKey = true` on the primary key column of dimension tables. Each dimension must have exactly ONE unique key column.
- Hide foreign key columns on the "many" side of relationships (`IsHidden = true`)
- Mark primary key columns on dimension tables (`IsKey = true`)

**DON'T:**
- Use Composite keys. They are NOT supported. 
- Do NOT create surrogate keys on Fact tables (memory waste)
- Use bi-directional cross-filtering unless strictly necessary (causes ambiguity and performance issues). If needed on many-to-many, always verify it is single-direction.
- Use many-to-many relationships unless required — they degrade performance. Keep bi-directional + many-to-many relationships below 30% of total relationships.
- Create inactive relationships unless they are activated via `USERELATIONSHIP` in at least one measure. Inactive relationships without a corresponding measure are orphaned and suggest incomplete modeling.
- Use `USERELATIONSHIP` against a table that also has Row-Level Security (causes errors).
- Have multiple fact tables relate to the same dimension through different key columns without a shared conformed dimension - this causes slicers on one fact to not filter the other.

## Date/Calendar Table

A Date/Calendar table is required for time-intelligence calculations such as Last Year or Year-To-Date.

**DO:**
- Use existing date table from data source (preferred).
- Create DAX calculated date table only if source table unavailable.
- Ensure contiguous date range (no gaps)
- Set the `dataCategory` property to "Time" for calendar tables.
- Ensure the common date attributes exist: Year, Quarter, Month, Day, Week (optional: Day of Week, Month Name)
- Configure the `sortByColumn` for text attributes such as "Month Name" (sort by month number to avoid alphabetical ordering).
- Disable auto-date tables if a proper date table exists. Auto date/time creates hidden `LocalDateTable_*` tables for every date column, which can significantly bloat memory in models with many date columns.

**DON'T:**
- Create a calendar table if there is a calendar table in the data source. Import that instead.
- Leave month name columns unsorted — they will sort alphabetically (April, August...) instead of chronologically.

## Hierarchies

**DO:**
- Create user hierarchies for common drill-down paths (e.g., Year > Quarter > Month > Day).
- Each hierarchy level must reference an existing column in the same table.
- Set meaningful level names that differ from the column names when appropriate.

**DON'T:**
- Create hierarchies with a single level (no drill-down value).
- Reference columns from other tables in hierarchy levels.

## Row-Level Security (RLS)

**DO:**
- Keep RLS filter expressions simple — push complex logic upstream to the data warehouse.
- Use single-direction relationships on security tables.
- Test RLS filters to ensure they return correct results.

**DON'T:**
- Use string manipulation functions (`RIGHT`, `LEFT`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `FIND`) in RLS expressions - offload to the data source.

## Descriptions & Documentation

**DO:**
- Add `description` to all visible tables, columns, and measures. Descriptions should make implicit knowledge explicit, not restate the object name.
- For measures with non-obvious logic, describe the business rule and when to use the measure vs similar alternatives.
- For models consumed by Copilot or data agents, write descriptions that disambiguate: "When a user asks for margin, use this measure (Standard Margin), not Gross Margin."
- Use `displayFolder` on measures to organize them into logical groups.

**DON'T:**
- Leave visible objects without descriptions - it hurts both human discoverability and AI accuracy.
- Write descriptions that only restate the name (e.g., `Total Sales` described as "The total sales").

## AI & Copilot Readiness

If the model will be consumed by Copilot or data agents, these additional practices apply:

- Avoid duplicate field names across tables (e.g., `Name` in both `Product` and `Customer`). AI interprets names literally and duplicates cause confusion. Use table-qualified names like `Product Name`, `Customer Name`.
- Configure synonyms for fields where users may use alternative terminology (e.g., "Revenue", "Sales", "Turnover" for the same measure).
- Add AI instructions to the model when common questions need steering (e.g., which date field to default to, which margin measure to prefer).
- Ensure all measures intended for AI are model-level, not report-scoped extension measures (invisible to data agents).
- Keep the AI data schema scoped - only expose tables and measures relevant to conversational use.

## Calculation Groups

**DO:**
- Use calculation groups for time intelligence variations (YTD, LY, etc.) to avoid measure explosion.
- Ensure calculation groups have at least one calculation item.
- Name calculation items clearly (e.g., `Current`, `YTD`, `PY`, `PY YTD`).

**DON'T:**
- Create empty calculation groups with no calculation items.
- Use calculation groups when simple measure variations are sufficient for a small number of measures.

## Performance Guidelines

**DO:**
- Prefer star schema over snowflake — avoid dimension-to-dimension relationships.
- Use `Int64` keys for relationships (faster than `String`).
- Minimize calculated columns — offload to the data source/warehouse when possible. Models with more than 5 calculated columns should be reviewed.
- If calculated columns use `RELATED()`, strongly consider moving that logic to the data source instead.
- Set `isAvailableInMdx = false` on hidden columns not used in `sortByColumn`, hierarchies, or variations.
- For DirectQuery models, be cautious with time-intelligence functions (known performance issues). Consider pre-calculating in the source.
- For DirectQuery with Power BI Premium, consider using aggregation tables to boost performance.
- Unpivot pivoted data (e.g., monthly columns like Jan, Feb, Mar) — import as rows, not columns.

**DON'T:**
- Use `Double` data type — use `Decimal` or `Int64`.
- Leave auto-date tables enabled when a proper date table exists.
- Create unnecessary bi-directional or many-to-many relationships.
- Include columns not needed for analysis — remove them at the source or hide them.

## Maintenance

- Remove hidden columns that are not referenced by any DAX expression, relationship, hierarchy, sort-by, or RLS.
- Remove hidden measures that are not referenced by any DAX expression.
- Remove inactive relationships not activated by any `USERELATIONSHIP` call.
- Remove unused data sources not referenced by any partition.
- Remove empty perspectives (perspectives with no tables).
- Fix referential integrity violations (orphan keys in fact tables not present in dimension tables).

## Parameters

Semantic Model parameters are commonly used to parameterize data source URLs, server names, database names, or storage accounts. Enables seamless CI/CD without editing M code of each table.

**DO:**
- Use parameters to centralize the data source location instead of duplicating the reference on each table. Examples: `ServerName`, `DatabaseName`
- Parameters are a named expression that can be referenced in Power Query M code.

**DON'T:**
- Change existing models to use parameters unless asked by the user.

**Example of semantic model using parameters:**

```tmdl
expression Server = "Server01" meta [IsParameterQuery=true, Type="Text", IsParameterQueryRequired=true]
expression Database = "Server01" meta [IsParameterQuery=true, Type="Text", IsParameterQueryRequired=true]

ref table TableName

		partition PartitionName = m
			mode: import
			source =
					let
					    Source = Sql.Database(#"Server", #"Database")~
                        ...

```
